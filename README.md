# PaperStore

Android application that allow us to match the string pattern in an image and upload it to firebase storage on positive pattern match.
App uses Firbase-ml-vision to recognise the text in the image.
Images can either be picked from the local storage or can be clicked from camera on the go.

Use case:
The main aim of this application is to help my college juniors so that they can easily maintain a repository of previous year question papers.
Text-Recognition will prevent uploading of unrelated images to the qustion paper repo automatically.

TODO:
Add fetch fucntionality so that question papers can easily be browsed within app itself or Make a web app for th same.
